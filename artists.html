        <p class="site-page-text">Still House Plants are a Glasgow-based three-piece collective made up of guitarist Finlay Clark, drummer David Kennedy and vocalist Jessica Hickie-Kallenbach. Their focus is on dissolving the boundaries between what constitutes music and art through collaboration and experimentation. Their first EP, released in July 2016, was Wire critic Frances Morgan's release of the year. They have been artists-in-residence for the CCA/AC Projects Music Residency, (Glasgow) and at The Pipe Factory, (Glasgow). The trio have since performed internationally, touring with Mette Rasmussen to perform at Ultra Eczema's 20th Anniversary, (Antwerp), Fasching Jazz Club, (Stockholm) with Rasmussen and Richard Dawson, as well as at KRAAK festival, (Brussels). Still House Plants are Cafe OTO Jerwood Residents 2018/19. </p>
